# in-class demo notes

- some users enter in name first, then hit timer start button
- some users scroll to the bottom of the page before inputting anything
- seem to be a lot of mental calculation between user's schedule/available times
    - may be because of unfamiliarity with given schedule
- scrolling necessary
    - page doesn't reset scroll to top of page after submission
